# i3-style

Make your [i3](http://i3wm.org) config a little more stylish.

## About

`i3-style` applies a theme to your i3 config file to change the colorscheme of the window decorations and the different parts of i3bar. It's designed especially for people who make frequent changes to their colorscheme to get things just right.

* Easy to try out new themes right after you install.
* Themes are easy to read, modify, and share.
* Modifies your theme in place - extra template files are not needed.

## Installing

If you have a Rust toolchain available, you can install with Cargo:

    cargo install i3-style

Otherwise, check the [releases](https://github.com/acrisci/i3-style/releases) page where I post precompiled binaries.

## Usage

Just call `i3-style` with the name of the theme you want to try and where you want to write the config file to. i3-style will look for your config in the default place and apply the theme.

    i3-style solarized -o ~/.config/i3/config --reload

Check the `themes` directory for the list of built-in themes.

    i3-style ~/.config/i3/solarized.yaml -o ~/.config/i3/config

Just keep doing that until you get it perfect (which might be never).

## Send us themes!

Do you have a cool colorscheme in your config file that you want to share with other people? i3-style can automatically convert it to a theme file:

    i3-style --to-theme ~/.config/i3/config -o my-theme.yaml

If you have a new theme, or made an improvement to an existing theme, please make a pull request adding your theme to the `themes` directory!
